Noteplaid
=========

Plaid text editor. Perfect for hipsters.

## Backstory
Noteplaid is a text editor that has a plaid background. It is essentially a Windows Notepad clone built using WPF in C#.

During a conversation, [Corban](https://github.com/corbanmailloux) stuttered when saying "Notepad," and the concept for Noteplaid was born. We made a GUI mockup that day, and then the project lay dormant for almost 3 months.

_And then it was finals week..._

The first version was built because Corban was procrastinating studying for a final. It now supports saving and loading files (which seems pretty standard for a text editor) and has built-in spell check!
